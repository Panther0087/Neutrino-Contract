# Neutrino Protocol
[Neutrino](https://beta.neutrino.at) is an algorithmic price-stable cryptocurrency protocol that allows for the creation of stable coins tied to a specific real world asset, such as national currency or commodity, and collateralized by a native token. The first synthetic asset created with Neutrino Protocol is USD Neutrino (USDN). Neutrino is currently in public beta.
